% I would like to thank my supervisor, Takeo Moroi, who provided
% stimulating discussions, helpful comments, fruitful suggestions and
% collaboration.  I am also grateful to Koichi Hamaguchi, Kazunori
% Nakayama, Natsumi Nagata and all the members of the particle physics
% group at the University of Tokyo for their hospitality.  My work is
% supported by the Program for Leading Graduate Schools, MEXT, Japan.
% Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my family, friends and
% all things which allow me to enjoy studying physics.
