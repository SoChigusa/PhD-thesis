\begin{abstract}
  There are many extensions of the standard model that predict the existence of electroweakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), in particular in the context of the dark matter.
  WIMPs, which may be the dominant component of the dark matter, can be searched for using several different methods, such as the direct and indirect detection of the dark matter and the direct production at collider experiments.
  However, it is known that Higgsino, which is an example of the WIMP contained in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model, is difficult to search for in many cases.
  In this thesis, we provide a way for indirectly studying WIMPs through the precision study of the pair production processes of charged leptons or that of a charged lepton and a neutrino at future $100\,\mathrm{TeV}$ collider experiments.
  It is revealed that this search method is suitable in particular for Higgsino, providing us the $5\sigma$ discovery reach of Higgsino in supersymmetric model with mass up to $850\,\mathrm{GeV}$.
  We also show that this search method provides important and independent information about every kind of WIMP in addition to Higgsino.
  Finally, we also discuss how accurately one can extract the mass, gauge charge, and spin of WIMPs in our method.
  The main part of this thesis is based on our works \cite{Chigusa:2018vxz,Abe:2019egv}.

There are many models that extend the standard model (SM) of the particle physics by introducing weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which have interactions with SM particles whose size is comparable to the electroweak gauge coupling.
We have many theoretical motivations to introduce WIMPs, some of which are listed below.
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    One of the motivations is the existence of the dark matter (DM) in our universe.
    When we assume a stable WIMP with its interaction strength comparable to the electroweak gauge coupling, its thermal relic abundance agrees with the observation if its mass is of $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$ or so.
  \item
    Such $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$ WIMPs often appear in well-motivated models beyond the standard model (BSM).
    For example, the following two models contain such WIMPs: the minimally supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) introduced to solve the hierarchy problem and the minimal dark matter (MDM) model that can explain the existence and stability of the DM in a minimal extension of the SM.
\end{itemize}
Besides, models with WIMPs are also phenomenologically interesting because
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Such $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$ WIMPs are likely to be discovered by many kinds of experiments such as the dark matter searches and the particle colliders.
\end{itemize}
Considering the second point, many of the WIMPs in the BSM models mentioned above have non-zero electroweak charges, which explain its weak interaction with SM particles.
In this thesis, we would like to focus on such kind of WIMPs and seek ways to search for them.\footnote
{
  The word ``WIMPs'' is usually used in a broader sense that includes particles with some unknown weak interactions with SM particles.
  To distinguish this usage with ours, which only denotes some particles with non-zero electroweak charge, it may be better to call them as ``WIMPs'', abbreviation of electroweakly interacting massive particles.
  However, within this thesis, we will just use ``WIMPs'' in a narrow sense obeying the widely spread custom.
}

In the MSSM, it is known that the supersymmetric (SUSY) partner of the electroweak gauge bosons or the Higgs boson can be the lightest supersymmetric particles (LSP) and are natural DM candidate.
In particular, there are well motivated scenarios where the so-called Higgsino or Wino play the role of the LSP, which transform as doublet and triplet under the weak $SU(2)_L$ gauge symmetry, respectively; light Higgsino is preferred to reduce the amount of the fine-tuning of the electroweak scale as in the ``natural SUSY'' set up~\cite{Kitano:2005wc, Brust:2011tb, Papucci:2011wy, Baer:2012uy}, while the so-called ``mini-split'' spectrum \cite{Wells:2003tf, Wells:2004di, ArkaniHamed:2004fb, Giudice:2004tc, ArkaniHamed:2004yi, ArkaniHamed:2005yv} with anomaly mediation \cite{Randall:1998uk, Giudice:1998xp} makes Wino LSP.
Another example, the MDM scenario \cite{Cirelli:2005uq, Cirelli:2007xd, Cirelli:2009uv}, introduces a larger $SU(2)_L$ multiplet, whose stability is automatically ensured by the charge assignment.
In particular, a 5-plet Majorana fermion with hypercharge zero is a good DM candidate that escape from the DM search experiments so far.

To search for WIMPs, several different approaches are adopted.
One way is to rely on DM search experiments, assuming that the WIMPs are the dominant component of the DM.
Firstly, there exist several direct detection experiments that utilize a scattering between the DM and the nucleus~\cite{Akerib:2016vxi, Cui:2017nnn, Aprile:2018dbl}.
Wino is one of the promising targets of these experiments, whose spin independent scattering cross section with a nucleon is almost mass independently given as $\sigma_p^{\mathrm{SI}} \simeq 2.3 \times 10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$~\cite{Hisano:2010fy, Hisano:2012wm, Hisano:2015rsa, Hill:2011be, Hill:2013hoa}, which is still an order of magnitude below the current experimental limit.
The situation for Higgsino highly depends on the size of the mixing between Higgsino and SUSY partners of electroweak gauge bosons (or electroweakinos).
However, it is particularly difficult to detect (almost) pure Higgsino DM since its scattering cross section is comparable to or below that of the neutrino background~\cite{Hisano:2012wm}.
The detection of MDM may also be difficult~\cite{Hisano:2011cs} since its possibly larger mass of $\mathcal{O} (10)\,\mathrm{TeV}$ weakens the sensitivity of direct detection experiments.

Secondly, a lot of efforts are devoted to detecting cosmic rays resulting from DM annihilation, namely the DM indirect detection~\cite{Fermi-LAT:2016uux, Ahnen:2016qkx, Abdallah:2016ygi, Gomez-Vargas:2013bea}.
Although the results suffer from some astrophysical uncertainties, they have already excluded, for example, Wino with mass less than $400\,{\rm GeV}$ and also around $2\,{\rm TeV}$~\cite{Bhattacherjee:2014dya}.
On the other hand, the corresponding Higgsino bound is weaker and it has been probed only up to $350\,{\rm GeV}$~\cite{Krall:2017xij} again due to the smallness of its $SU(2)_L$ charge.
For the MDM, 5-plet fermion is analyzed as an example in \cite{Abdalla:2018mve} and the mass less than $2\,~{\rm TeV}$ and several narrow regions are excluded.
Note again that the WIMPs must be the dominant component of the DM for these approaches to be sensitive.

Another way of probing WIMPs is the direct production at the large hadron collider (LHC).
One of the good strategies of the collider search for WIMPs is to use the disappearing charged track signal, which indicates a long-lived charged particle, the charged components of the WIMP in the current case.
Both ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced a result of this method with the data of $\sqrt{s} = 13\,{\rm TeV}$ LHC \cite{Aaboud:2017mpt, ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-019, Sirunyan:2018ldc}.
The current lower bound on the mass of the pure Higgsino-like (Wino-like) state is $152~(460)\,{\rm GeV}$ at $95\,\%$ C.L.
We can obtain a similar bound for the MDM using the same method~\cite{Ostdiek:2015aga}.
In this method, however, the bound strongly depends on the lifetime of the charged component, which is sensitive to the mass difference between the charged and the neutral components.
In particular, it is often the case in the SUSY model that the Higgsino-like LSP and its charged counterpart possess a non-negligible fraction of electroweakinos, which significantly enhances the mass difference compared to the pure Higgsino case.
In such a case, the lifetime of the charged component is extremely short, making the disappearing track search challenging.
There is another option called mono-X search to search for a new physics signal in general.
However, the corresponding bound is usually very weak due to the large SM background and no bound is imposed on Higgsino at $\sqrt{s} = 14\,{\rm TeV}$ LHC~\cite{Baer:2014cua}.

Given this situation, it has been discussed that indirect search for WIMPs using precision measurement is useful~~\cite{Alves:2014cda, Gross:2016ioi, Farina:2016rws,Harigaya:2015yaa, Matsumoto:2017vfu, DiLuzio:2018jwd, Matsumoto:2018ioi}.
It utilizes a pair production of charged leptons or that of a charged lepton and a neutrino, where WIMPs affect the pair production processes through the vacuum polarizations of the electroweak gauge bosons.
The current status and future prospects have been analyzed for several different setups, indicating that it provides a promising way to probe Higgsino as well as the other WIMPs.
A virtue of this method is that it is robust against the change of the lifetime and the decay modes of WIMPs and whether an WIMP constitutes a sizable portion of the DM or not.
Another important point is that, due to WIMPs, the invariant mass distributions of the final state particles show sharp dip-like behavior at the invariant mass close to twice the WIMP mass.
It helps us to distinguish the WIMP effects from backgrounds and systematic errors.
This second point, however, also indicates that we need sufficiently large number of events with $\mathrm{TeV}$-scale or sub-$\mathrm{TeV}$ invariant masses.
As a result, the prospect of the reach for Higgsino in the literature is still unsatisfactory; $m_\chi \lesssim 100 \hyphen 200\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for the high luminosity LHC \cite{Matsumoto:2017vfu,  Matsumoto:2018ioi} and $m_\chi \lesssim 500\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for lepton colliders with $\sqrt{s}=1\,\mathrm{TeV}$ assuming $1\,\%$ systematic errors \cite{Harigaya:2015yaa}.

Thus, it is important to consider the application of this method for higher energy colliders.
In particular, in this thesis, we study the prospect of the indirect search method at future $100\,{\rm TeV}$ hadron colliders such as FCC-hh at CERN~\cite{Mangano:2016jyj, Contino:2016spe, Golling:2016gvc} or SppC in China~\cite{CEPC-SPPCStudyGroup:2015csa, CEPC-SPPCStudyGroup:2015esa}.
We concentrate on the lepton pair production processes since they provide a very clean signal without any hadronic jets at least from the final state particles.
We will show that it provides a comparable or better experimental reach for Higgsino compared to the direct production search of WIMPs at future colliders~\cite{Low:2014cba, Cirelli:2014dsa, Han:2018wus, Mahbubani:2017gjh}.
This method also provides independent and additional information about Wino and the MDM.
Besides, we will reveal that this method is useful to investigate WIMP properties, such as charges, masses, and spins.
