\vskip 0.1in

In this appendix, we explain the procedure we have adopted to implement the MDM model into the numerical calculation performed in \ref{sec:direct}.

In the Listing \ref{list:mdm}, we show a part of our \texttt{FeynRules} model file \texttt{mdm.fr}.
This corresponds to the necessary additional description to the SM model file \texttt{sm.fr} to take account of the $5$-plet fermion.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=\texttt{mdm.fr}, label=list:mdm, float=b]
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
   printf("Hello world!");
}
\end{lstlisting}
